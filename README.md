How to use the application:
First run server_java_tcp on on terminal and then run client_java_tcp on another terminal. 
The command to run server_java_tcp is:

java server_java_tcp portNumber < welcomeMessage.txt

where portNumber must be from 1024 to 65535, 
and where welcomeMessage.txt is a text file with one line (welcome.txt is provided)

The command to run client_java_tcp is:

java client_java_tcp IPAddress portNumber userName 

where the portNumber should be the same as the one used in server_java_tcp, 
and IPAddress is should be 127.0.0.1 on the same device.

Please type the commands ("send","print","exit") exactly how they are spelled, no upper case letters.

How the application works:
This application uses RSA and AES to confidentially transfer messages between the server and client. It begins by having the server create the public/private key pair and sends the public key to the client. The client uses the public key to encrypt the session key (generated by the client, a new one is used for each execution of the client) and sends it to server. The server decyrpts the session key and saves it. When sending a message the client uses the session key to encrypt the message and the server decrypts it and saves it. When printing all of the messages, the server uses the session key to encrypt the messages and the client decrypts them and displays them for the user.


I plan on adding more functionalities when time permits.
